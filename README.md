##### Project consists of 3 Jupyter Notebook files, 2 python scripts and files needed to run recommender remotely on streamlit: 
##### The "Final_project_EDA" notebook is used for exploratory data analyses, data preprocessing and feature engineering as well as preparation of the final datasets for house price prediction. 
##### The "Final_project_modelling" notebook is used for actual modelling the house price prediction.
##### Thy "Recommendation_of_area_by_customer notebook creates imaginary dataset of homeowners in Austin and models the recommendation classifier of a certain area/zipcode in Austin for purchase.
