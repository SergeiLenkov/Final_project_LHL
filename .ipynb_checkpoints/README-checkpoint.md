## Project Overview

##### This project creates several models predicting house prices in Austin using the Austin Housing Price Dataset from Kaggle.com
##### Project consists of 3 Notebook files and python script: 
##### The first one is used for EDA, data preprocessing and feature engineering as well as preparation of the final datasets for house price prediction. 
##### The second one is used for actual modelling the house price prediction.
##### Thy third one is made for modelling a recommendation classifier of a certain area/zipcode in Austin. An imaginary dataset of home buyers was created.
